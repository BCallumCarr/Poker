Blog is live and amazing, poker game executes and is really nicely formatted but seems like it isn't always 100% correct.

For e.g. I got the following output which looks erroneous:

```Bob's hand:

Q of Hearts
4 of Spades
K of Clubs
8 of Clubs
J of Hearts


Bob2's hand:

2 of Spades
4 of Clubs
K of Diamonds
2 of Diamonds
Q of Diamonds


Brett's hand:

2 of Hearts
5 of Diamonds
6 of Diamonds
6 of Hearts
K of Spades


Brad's hand:

3 of Spades
9 of Hearts
A of Spades
8 of Spades
8 of Diamonds

Duplicate, breaking ties...
The winner is Bob2 ! Winner won by High Card```
